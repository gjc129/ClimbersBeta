# ClimbersBeta

Climbers Beta is a mobile application that helps rock climbers find places to climb outdoors, including a discussion board for climbers to communicate with each other, and descriptions of outdoor climbing routes.

This application helps climbers have a better experience when outdoor climbing by having information available for all the best outdoor crags(rock formations for climbing), detailed descriptions for routes of all types including: bouldering, sport and traditional climbing from fellow climbers.
